REVIEW,RATING,SENTIMENT
"honestly this app just keeps getting worse, and it's a shame they don't fix the problems they create. by far the worst sin this app makes is the constant ""refreshing"" every time you go back to your feed... read some comments on a post, press back, and 75% of the time you'll never see that post again. the suggested tweets and accounts and topics are usually pretty damn bad. they keep trying to make Spaces a thing. would be nice if I could just... you know... see top tweets from people I follow?",2,Neutral
"I've been having problems with getting my main account to load quickly, and I'm having trouble with the follow request function on my private account. isn't showing me any button to check/accept a request, and it takes a minute for it to load my main account when I switch to it. otherwise haven't had any problems with accounts or tweets, all is good except for problems mentioned above :)",3,Neutral
"I enjoy using Twitter, but this last month it just started constantly crashing. Whether I'm in the middle of commenting, posting something, or simply browsing it will start to lag gradually and then stop/ freeze nearly breaking my phone and then crashing. I have to keep force closing and re opening the app through my own app manager.",3,Positive
"Meeting those that keep your head up high, even though it's low. Those to follow, to inspire you, to keep walking on the path, when you want to give up. Because they are indeed on the other side, yet the same, those without ego, yet power. I follow those that built bridges. May I be fortunate to walk on, over. Their answer, I know them well, I do. ""It's up to you baby, we're waiting"". I Love the Birds I Follow, Fly with. I Love them as if I know them. They are excellent humans, creators & Love",5,Neutral
"They seem determined to make this unusable, no matter how much I select not interested they keep throwing things I don't want into my feed. It's reached the point where even telling it no on each and every post, there's more content from random people than the ones I actually choose to follow.",1,Positive
"Nearly unusable if you are trying to catch up on an active DM conversation, as the screen jumps around with each new message even while you are trying to scroll. Headache inducing, literally, even with the ""Reduce Motion"" setting on. 2022: Issue persists, DMs 'jump' constantly with each new message. Would give lower stars if possible.",1,Neutral
"Twitter Spaces crashes from time to time, I'm not sure what causes it but it'll usually happen after I'm in a Space for at least 3 minutes. Overall, the app has been slow to load profiles, tweets, search results, etc for the past few months. Clearing the app cache helps but only for a bit. When I clear the cache, it's only clearing out a couple hundred MBs, so I feel like it's not on my end. Please look into this, it has made the mobile experience inconvenient.",3,Neutral
"I have two problems and both are linked together. When sending tweets to friends through DM, the tweet is turned into a link, this wasn't an issue until a few months ago and when this happens, people don't get the notification of me sending a tweet to them or vice versa. It is incredibly infuriating where hours go by without even knowing if you got a DM from someone because of this. Please fix this.",3,Neutral
I cannot post anything right now.... what is going on?,2,Neutral
If not for the random freezes it would be a 5. I had to uninstall and reinstall because it got to the point of freezing 50-60 times per day I do wish there was a way to completely turn off DMs. You call them messages. I believe a very significant percentage of users would like to eliminate this very annoying feature. It is used primarily by scammers.,4,Neutral
"Sick and tired of the damned app constantly refreshing. Tried all the tips I've found in a web search to get it to stop, but none of them work. Now I read that they've fixed the issue but you need to subscribe to blue to get it. You want to show ads, fine, but don't hide fixes to long known problems behind a paywall. Shame on you!",1,Neutral
"Good app but there's a few things going wrong with it recently that makes me want to leave a less-than-positive review. Whenever I tap on a tweet to read replies, and tap on an individual reply, backing out automatically scrolls me back to the top to see the parent tweet instead of leaving me at that point in the replies, which is infuriating. And images in my main feed go from edge to edge on my screen instead of having a border around them like they used to, and I can't even toggle it.",2,Positive
