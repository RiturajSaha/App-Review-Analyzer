"I don't know if an upgrade was done or what is going on, but Facebook has been giving me lots of issues! First , it will tell me I have notifications, but when I click on the tab, it only shows me the same notifications from days ago. Also, for my news feed, it is showing me my friends post form days ago. It's not showing me recent things. Plus it will not allow me to upload photos. I have Un installed it and re installed it and continue to have the same issues....I do hope it gets fixed soon!!",3,Neutral
"The moderating bots are really awful. They will flag just about anything, and you get put in extensive time out. You can't get them to fix it either, you're stuck with the restrictions until it ends, and they add on to it if you try to do anything about it. Just really unfair, in my opinion. I've had people reported for posting awful stuff and the bot doesn't find anything wrong, or people will impersonate loved ones and the bots don't do anything either, but you'll get a restricted for nothing.",1,Negative
"The notifications get annoying when you are trying to check them and scroll down to the oldest one, a new one comes in and it takes you right to the top again so you have to scroll down and start over. An then just yesterday, I help run a FB Rottie group to help dogs in need of Rescue from the Shelter's. FB flagged us for standards saying violence,drugs,guns etc but there's nothing like that on there. So I don't get it when we are no different than the other groups doing the same.",3,Neutral
"To many ads, even when you turn them off-- marketplace might as well be like Amazon because I can't even search for local items without stuff you have to order in the mix. Throws you 30 mile places but says it's in your location. The messanger app when with multiple accounts keeps you with a notification so that you think you got a message on the other account, but you go and check, and there's nothing, but the other one gets a little icon then. The calling quality has gone down dramatically",1,Positive
Everything has been fine with the app. Besides now every time I get on. It says error loading news feed. I can see my memories or my profile. But not my news feed. And even before the new changes. I have not been able to use the avatars as my backgrounds . They are not an option for Me. Please help fix these issues üòí,3,Neutral
Works when it wants doesn't work an awful lot. I can barely be on this app it's showing posts from 3 days ago not loading I can't see pictures. Afraid of where all my pictures are. I use Facebook lite and it works better then this but still awful and slow. And now I can't get to my child's messenger for kids because it says I need to update this app which I have the latest updated version. This is ridiculous.,1,Neutral
"Would be better if you could show that you're in a relationship with multiple people üëçüèªüëâüèª I'm not one of those people that shout for inclusion usually, but it just seems weird that an app trying to appeal to the masses wouldn't have the option to tag more than one person in a relationship. (Poly people have probs been wanting this for a while) Not to much coding or extra steps to pull off, and could be easily added in a near future update. I'm just sayin ü§∑ üòå",3,Positive
"Fix the app!!! It's getting ridiculous how many times I have to either restart my phone, or uninstall and reinstall Facebook, to get it working again! And then it doesn't work. AGAIN. It's a never ending loop of it not working. It won't load notifications, it won't load videos, my news feed won't refresh, etc üò° This has been going on for over a month now. I know it's Facebook that is buggy, and not my phone, because I just upgraded my phone and it works just fine with everything else.",1,Positive
"I'm sick of the ads and they keep getting worse. I've updated my preferences, I've told it not to show me things, I've hidden ads from certain companies ... I still see them AND it keeps throwing more and more at me. Marketplace is a joke because of so many ads. Even when I tell it to only show me local items, it's still ad after ad after ad. I'm done with it all. Facebook, you've destroyed your own app by catering to advertisers.",1,Neutral
"The app has not been working for me for several weeks now. I can not see pictures or videos in my news feed, profile, or any pages I look at, my notifications won't load, can't delete my own posts, likes are not going through, won't let me log out or change accounts. I've tried to report it several times but that doesn't appear to be working either...",1,Positive
"This app keeps on crashing and every time I press Wait, it does nothing. I'm not able to type especially when I'm on Marketplace or writing a post. This is redundant and should be dealt with! You're going to lose more people if this keeps on happening. When you choose to write a report, the site goes DARK. What are y'all UP TO?",1,Positive
"Marketplace is a disaster. The search is useless. Nothing shows up. I'm searching basic terms like ""trailer"" and it shows less than 10 listings within 50 miles of Detroit before it starts showing things that are 100 plus miles away. Marketplace also won't show photos of any items. The photo will flash up on the screen and immediately goes white. If you can see photos, it won't let you scroll to any additional photos. Pretty hard to buy something you can't look at.",1,Neutral
