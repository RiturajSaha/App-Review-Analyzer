REVIEW,RATING,SENTIMENT
"Horrible experience. The customer service is ridiculous. Auto generated mails aligned with every help and support and this is by far the worst customer support. I am being charged for 3months (total â‚¹1500), but the money is going no where. I cancelled my investment, decided for refund to stop the nuisance. Instead, I was charged for another month even after my cancellation. No one knows where the money went. If you don't know how your technology works, better shut it down, you cheaters!",1,Positive
"This app works very well.. I've been using it for quite sometime.. it works very smoothly. I would definitely recommend it to everyone. As for people giving negative reviews , I'd like to say that during heavy traffic sometimes the app lags. But it happens with every app , nothing to get worried about . Have some patience.",5,Neutral
"I am continuously facing issue with the app, it fails to show the dashboard stating some errors, same is the problem with the desktop version. This kind of issues at the market hour causes losses to us. Its like we have been temporarily blindfolded. I would like to ask the developers that i can understand if it had happened once, but this thing has happened numerous times. Do you all have any explanations, or it seems you all are not even aware of it",1,Neutral
"Yesterday I downloaded this app just coz my friend recommended me to. It worked fine for few hours. However, the app stopped responding afterwards. I tried to log out & then log in again. Still the same! M highly disappointed. Since it's an investing app, & if such things continue to happen how the hell people are supposed to take investment decisions at the right time! It would be better if the team do feel the necessity to fix the issue!",1,Neutral
"""First impression is the last impression"" & specially when it's about returning your money on time. The app showed me a particular time frame by when my withdrawal will be credited back to my account. One of the advisors from there customer support also committed the same. Then guess what, I DID NOT get the money back on the time commited & still waiting for the same.",1,Neutral
"Sometimes the experience is very good but most of the times it does not let me login into my account and no matter how much you try you can not login and one time I was loggedin but as I had fingerprint security and when I put my finger on it it said wrong Id, try again and I had just opened the app a minute ago and it was working. And now because of this I can not login into my account to check my investments.",1,Neutral
"Their basic systems are problematic. Free / Unused Funds in demat not getting transferred to bank account at all. For multiple outgoing transfer, funds not reaching to bank. Their team says, we have reconciliation issues. I cannot understand that why money which one have added him self and hast been used for trade is getting blocked. Please be aware and careful. They have no support other than super slow email service. Ticket 4568557",1,Neutral
"First thing, i would like to say is that it has many technical issues. I have been using this app for the last 3 months and was not facing much technical issues. However after the recent update, it's not the same anymore. My portfolios sometimes gets dissappear, and then shows again after a while leading to tense situations and difficulties in trading. Please do fix this error.",3,Positive
